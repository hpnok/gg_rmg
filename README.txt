how to use:
place mapgenerator.exe and the RMG_resource folder in the same folder than your gg2 executable.
add the koth_random.gml plugin to your plugins
at the end of a match, if the next map in your rotation is koth_random, cp_random or dkoth_random then the plugin will instead generate a map with the matching game mod
the first map loaded on a server won't be randomly generated (the client will try to get koth_random.png)
